# Image-Recognition

Using a dataset obtained from kaggle, this will identify chest x-ray images as normal vs pneumonia and further as normal vs viral pneumonia vs bacteria pneumonia. There are a total of 5863 x-ray images of JPEG format in the dataset. The latest update in the data was in 2018. Data Size is 1GB which is a good and manageable size to work with. It is classified into three folders of train, test and validation. These folders have subfolders for image categories pneumonia or normal. Pictures in the “pneumonia” file have “virus” or “bacteria” included in the file names which will allow for us to split the data into three labeled groups.
